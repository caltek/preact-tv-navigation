# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue
After implementing the Preact Spatial Navigation library, arrow key navigation wasn't working. Elements would receive initial focus but navigation between elements failed.

## Root Cause
The problem was that the `focusable` class was being **removed from elements when they received focus**. 

### Why This Happened
When using `className={`demo-button ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}`, the className attribute was being completely replaced, which removed the `focusable` class that `useFocusable` had added to the element.

**Before fix:**
- Element unfocused: `class="demo-button focusable"` ✅
- Element focused: `class="demo-button focused"` ❌ (missing "focusable"!)

js-spatial-navigation uses `.focusable` selector to find navigable elements, so once an element lost this class, it became invisible to the navigation system.

## Solution

### 1. Preserve the `focusable` Class
Always include `focusable` in the className string when using `useFocusable`:

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - will lose focusable class
const { ref, focused } = useFocusable();
<div ref={ref} className={`my-class ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}>

// ✅ CORRECT - keeps focusable class
const { ref, focused } = useFocusable();
<div ref={ref} className={`my-class focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}>
```

### 2. Fixed Components
Updated all demo components to include `focusable` in their className:

**FocusableButton:**
```tsx
className={`demo-button focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}
```

**GridItem:**
```tsx
className={`grid-item focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}
```

**ListItem:**
```tsx
className={`list-item focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}
```

**NavigationMenu items:**
```tsx
className={`nav-item focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}
```

**Genre cards:**
```tsx
className={`genre-card focusable ${focused ? 'focused' : ''}`}
```

### 3. Additional Fixes

#### Added Default Section
In `SpatialNavigationContext.tsx`, added a default section for standalone focusable elements:

```tsx
// Add default section for elements not in specific sections
SpatialNavigation.add('', {
  selector: '.focusable',
  restrict: 'self-first',
  enterTo: 'last-focused',
});

// Make all focusable elements focusable in the default section
setTimeout(() => {
  SpatialNavigation.makeFocusable('');
}, 100);
```

#### Fixed Grid/List Components
Both `Grid.tsx` and `List.tsx` now:
- Use `useMemo` for stable section IDs
- Call `SpatialNavigation.makeFocusable(sectionId)` after registration
- Re-make elements focusable when children change
- Set container `id` attribute to match section ID

#### Fixed useFocusable Hook
In `useFocusable.ts`:
- Calls `SpatialNavigation.makeFocusable()` after element setup
- Uses a ref to prevent duplicate makeFocusable calls

## Testing Results

✅ **Arrow key navigation works perfectly:**
- Down arrow: navigates from menu to buttons
- Right arrow: navigates horizontally through items
- Grid navigation: moves correctly in 2D grid layout
- List navigation: moves through vertical/horizontal lists
- Section boundaries: properly transitions between sections

✅ **Focus states display correctly:**
- Yellow border shows on focused element
- Pulsing animation enhances visibility
- No background color (per user preference)

## Best Practices

When using this library, **always remember to:**

1. **Keep the `focusable` class:** Include it in your className along with custom classes
2. **Don't overwrite className:** Add to it, don't replace it
3. **Use focusedClassName option:** For complex styling, use the `focusedClassName` config option:

```tsx
const { ref, focused } = useFocusable({
  focusedClassName: 'my-focus-class',
});
<div ref={ref} className="my-base-class focusable" />
```

The `focusedClassName` will be automatically added/removed by the hook without affecting the `focusable` class.

## Files Modified

### Library Files:
- `/lib/context/SpatialNavigationContext.tsx` - Added default section
- `/lib/components/Grid.tsx` - Fixed section registration and makeFocusable calls
- `/lib/components/List.tsx` - Fixed section registration and makeFocusable calls
- `/lib/hooks/useFocusable.ts` - Added makeFocusable call and tracking ref

### Demo Files:
- `/src/app.tsx` - Added `focusable` class to all component classNames

## Reference

Based on the [js-spatial-navigation demo](https://luke-chang.github.io/js-spatial-navigation/demo/2.1_multiple_sections.html), proper integration requires:
1. Elements must have the `.focusable` class
2. Sections must be registered with proper IDs
3. `makeFocusable()` must be called after elements are added
4. Section containers should have `id` attributes matching their section ID
